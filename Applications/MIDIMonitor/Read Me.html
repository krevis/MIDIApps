<P><b>MIDI Monitor</b> is a utility for Mac OS X which displays MIDI signals in a variety of formats. It can watch both incoming and outgoing MIDI streams, and can filter them by message type and channel.
<P>
Musicians will find it handy for tracking down confusing MIDI problems, and programmers can use it to test MIDI drivers and applications.
<P>MIDI Monitor is FREE to download and use.  The source code is available as Open Source (under the BSD license).
<P>Please note that MIDI Monitor requires Mac OS X 10.2 or later.

<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="arial, helvetica"><b>How do I install it?</b></font>
<P>Just drag the MIDI Monitor icon wherever you want it.  Typically you would copy it to the Applications folder (the main one on your hard drive, or the one in your home folder), but you can put it anywhere you like.  That's all!
