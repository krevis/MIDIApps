<P><b>SysEx Librarian</b> is a utility for Mac OS X which lets you communicate with MIDI devices using System Exclusive messages, also known as SysEx. The most common use is to backup patch data from synthesizers, although there are others (such as sending firmware updates).  SysEx Librarian makes it easy to keep a library of the SysEx files you use most often, and to record new SysEx files.
<P>SysEx Librarian is FREE to download and use. The source code is available as Open Source (under the BSD license).
<P>Please note that SysEx Librarian requires Mac OS X 10.3.9 or later.

<P><BR><BR><font size="+1" face="arial, helvetica"><b>How do I install it?</b></font>
<P>Just drag the SysEx Librarian icon wherever you want it.  Typically you would copy it to the Applications folder (the main one on your hard drive, or the one in your home folder), but you can put it anywhere you like.  That's all!
